      `Due to their finely-honed sense of danger, a bodyguard starts out with a 3-in-6 chance at the Perception skill, that slowly improves as they gain levels\n\n` +
      `***Greater  Carrying  Capacity***\n` +
      `Furthermore, bodyguards are used to working while weighed down with body-armour, weapons and other equipment, even when others are less well equipped. \n` +
      `They calculate encumbrance as if they were carrying 5 less items than they actually are (effectively, they are one step less encumbered than a non-bodyguard would be)\n\n` +
      `******Combat Manoeuvres******\n` +
      `Like Mercenaries, bodyguards tend to be familiar with a wide variety of combat styles.\n` +
      `They take no penalty when making the Fight Defensively, Fight Recklessly, Go for the Kill, and Aim combat actions.\n` +
      `Likewise, a bodyguard can take the Covering Fire combat action with a pistol, standard rifle, marksmanâ€™s rifle, or shotgun.\n\n` +
      `******Better Constitution****** (CALCULATED)\n` +
      `Lastly, a bodyguard is better able to cope with pain and injury. They treat their Constitution modifier as one point better\n`
